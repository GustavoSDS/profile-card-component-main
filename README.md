### What I learned

Use this section to recap some of your main learnings while working on this project. Writing them down and providing code examples of the areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

-I'm not used to using pure css. For this project I had to learn the use of many CSS components. In particular, I have learned to use flexbox, grid, and the use of media queries. This helped me improve my development process.

I'm not sure if these are the correct styles for the `<hr>` tag in this project, but they are the ones I used.
```html
  <hr />
```
```css
  hr {
  border: 0;
  height: 1px;
  opacity: 0.5;
  background-color: var(--darkGray);
}
```
